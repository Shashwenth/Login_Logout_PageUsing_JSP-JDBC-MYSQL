# Login_Logout_PageUsing_JSP-JDBC-MYSQL

This is a basic login, logout page implemented using Java, JDBC, JSP and MYSql database. 
This is the first phase of our Online Auction website which I will be uploading in the upcoming weeks.
The reason I am uploading this is to help new software engineers who would like to start from the basic stuff and I will be really happy if this repo is helpful for atleast one student who wants to learn and build a web application project.
